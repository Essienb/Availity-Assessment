    <h2> 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project:</h2>
        <p>
            The project that I am proudest of is Called "AFFECTLI". It is built from an Idea that I had on how
            to completely eliminate manual network services and infrastructure management, ticketing system,
            fault reconciliation process and Billing reconciliation process. IHS Towers had become the largest
            Telecoms Tower collocation company in Africa but most of it's critical processes were being managed
            manually.
        <p>
            I put together a team of Software Engineers, Database Engineers, Cloud Architects,
            Datacenter experts etc and we were able to build the "Affectli" Application from scratch into a world
            class Network Intelligence management application with capacity for Asset Management, Distpach management,
            Remote monitoring, Analytics, Cell Site integration, Incident Management, Problem Management,
            Reconciliation, Customer management interface etc. It also was built to integrate with any ticket
            system that supports; REST/SOAP protocols, ERPs, Employee management, travelling Engineers real time
            tracking, Employee shift roaster management etc.
        </p>

        <p> The backend was majorly Java, Javascript, Activiti,
            AWS cloud, oracle Database, Level 3 datacenter to support the cloud infrastructure.
            AFFECTLI is a trusted Business Operating System that orchestrates disparate systems & data seamlessly
            into a single real-time overview of the organisation.

    <h2> 2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github
        Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc): </h2>
        <p>
            I was studying about RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker.
            One of the reasons is because it is lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in cloud. It
            supports multiple messaging protocols examples like Messaging Queue Telemetry Transport(MQTT), Simple
            Text-Oriented Messaging Protocol(STOMP), and Advanced Message Queue Protocol(AMQP).
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the feature of RabbitMQ is that it supports Transactional messaging, messaging as a Cloud
            Service, allows you the publish and subscribe, automatic protocols assigment, real time events feed.
            The outstanding thing about it is the fact that you can send enormous volume of messages while still
            receiving status updates because of its asynchronous messaging capability. Through this study I was
            able to built two Applications that used RabbitMQ to deliver messages with different topics to various
            destinations.

    <h2> 3. How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does? </h2>
        <p>
            Grandma I have found a place like a one stop shop where all your medical and health plans related
            questions can be answered. This is the same website health care providers use to access patients
            information such as eligibility, benefits, claim status, authorization, multiple health plan providers at
            no cost. Availity makes access to health coverage and benefits easily available in one place.
